# Docs

This directory contains the Casper CDP protocol documentation set. All documents are written **for Casper**.

## Principles (Required)

- **Casper-only**: Do not include content for other chains.
- **No hard-coded ambiguous values**: decimals/scale/rate sources/addresses (hashes), etc. must be defined **only through the confirmation process**.
